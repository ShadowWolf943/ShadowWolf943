### Greetings everyone 👋👋

- 💻 I’m a complete newbie in the programming space 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to create music and art while also writing code, in order to fullfil my dream of making 
      a game
- 🐍 My path has now begun on Python
- 👯 I’m looking forward to collaborating on anything that can expand my knowledge on coding, but mainly on any AI or 
     game dev related project
- 😄 Pronouns: He/him
- ⚡ Quick fact about me:  50 % of my body is made of coffee and energy drinks. (trust me on my maths 🙏🙏)

:)
